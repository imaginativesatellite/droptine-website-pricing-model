/**
 * Transactional email templates.
 *
 * The built-in defaults below are the source of truth for wording. Admins can
 * override any template's subject/body from the admin "Emails" tab; an override
 * is stored as an `EmailTemplate` row and takes precedence at send time. If no
 * override exists, the default here is used - so the app always sends sensible
 * copy even with an empty table.
 *
 * Bodies are HTML with {{variable}} placeholders filled in at send time (see
 * `fillTemplate`). User-supplied values (names, emails, codes) are HTML-escaped
 * by the caller before substitution.
